# Dominant-Color-Extractor-Using-K-Means

This project focuses on extracting k most dominant colors from an input image. 

Each pixel in an image can be represented by an array of its [R,G,B] value where R,G,B are in the range[0,255].

Using the K means clustering algorithm we can find k number of clusters of from the given image. The centroid of each cluster represents one of the dominant colors.
## input
image.png and number of dominant colors required
## output
A color palette consisting of the k most dominant colors extracted from the image
## use cases
Image Compression by Reducing Color Features.

Extracting color palettes for UI/UX design inspiration
